# The Lazy Reader
### A simple extension that reads text content for you.

It uses OpenAIs TextToSpeech API and Mozillas Readability library for parsing whole pages.

### Installation
Download the source code, if you have git installed:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ellonde/lazy-reader.git
```

Otherwise click the blue Code button on this page and download the source code as zip. After that unzip the code somewhere.

Now you have the code you just need to go to your browser(one that handles chrome extensions), go to the extension settings page. and click "Load unpacked". Navigate to the folder of the source code and you should be up and running.

And onboarding page will appear where you'll need to provide your OpenAI API key(yes, im not gonna pay for you!).

[If you dont know how to get one of those]( https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=how+to+get+openai+api+key)

You paste your key, (dont worry it just stored locally) and this should be working. You can try it on the onboarding page or try to navigate to a site and right click some marked text.
